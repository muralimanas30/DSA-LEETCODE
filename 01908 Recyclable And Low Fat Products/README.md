---

## üí° **Problem Explanation**

The problem requires you to retrieve the `product_id` from a `Products` table where the product is both low fat (`low_fats = 'Y'`) and recyclable (`recyclable = 'Y'`). Essentially, you need to filter the table based on these two criteria and return the ID of the products that satisfy both conditions.

**Sample Input:**

Consider a `Products` table with the following data:

| product_id | low_fats | recyclable |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 0          | Y        | N          |
| 1          | Y        | Y          |
| 2          | N        | Y          |
| 3          | Y        | Y          |
| 4          | N        | N          |

**Expected Output:**

The query should return the following `product_id` values:

| product_id |
|------------|
| 1          |
| 3          |

These products are both low fat and recyclable.

## üìä **Algorithm**

*   Select the `product_id` column from the `Products` table.
*   Filter the rows based on two conditions:
    *   `low_fats` must be equal to 'Y'.
    *   `recyclable` must be equal to 'Y'.
*   Return the filtered `product_id` values.

## üî• **Code Implementation**

```sql
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
```

## üöÄ **Time & Space Complexity**

*   **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is **O(n)**, where n is the number of rows in the `Products` table. This is because the SQL query needs to scan each row to check if it meets the specified conditions.
*   **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is **O(1)**, meaning constant space. The query doesn't use extra space that scales with the input size. It only stores the `product_id` values that meet the conditions, and the number of such values does not affect the fundamental space usage of the query execution.
